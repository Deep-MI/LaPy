LaPy is an `open-source Python package <project github_>`_ for differential
geometry on triangle and tetrahedra meshes. It includes an FEM solver to
estimate the Laplace, Poisson or Heat equations. Further functionality
includes the computations of gradients, divergence, mean-curvature flow,
conformal mappings, geodesics, ShapeDNA (Laplace spectra), and IO and
plotting methods. 

LaPy is written purely in Python 3 without sacrificing speed as almost all
loops are vectorized, drawing upon efficient and sparse mesh data structures.
