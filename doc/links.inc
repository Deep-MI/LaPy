.. This (-*- rst -*-) format file contains commonly used link targets and name
   substitutions.  It may be included in many files, therefore it should only
   contain link targets and name substitutions. Try grepping for "^\.\. _" to
   find plausible candidates for this list.

.. NOTE: reST targets are
   __not_case_sensitive__, so only one target definition is needed for:
   nipy, NIPY, Nipy, etc...
