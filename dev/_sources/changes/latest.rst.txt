Version 1.0
===========

API changes
-----------

- Classes: TriaMesh, TetMesh, and Solver are still available directly at top level and imported directly from lapy.
- Mesh IO: mesh classes have been extended with IO class member functions and TriaIO and TetIO have been deprecated. Use read\_* and write\_* class members to load and write mehses, for example, TriaMesh.read_vtk() to import a VTK triangle mesh file. This simplifies IO greatly.
- Module names have been changed to comply with PEP8 conventions (lower case). For example, DiffGeo to diffgeo, FuncIO to io, and Plot to plot, etc. 

Bugs
----

- Fixed numpy deprecation issue in import_vfunc and import_ev functions.

Enhancements
------------

- Comply with the numpy convention for docstrings (by `Andreas Girodi`_, `Kersten Diers`_ and `Martin Reuter`_ in :pr:`19` and :pr:`21`)
- Add initial documentation build (by `Mathieu Scheltienne`_ in :pr:`22`)
